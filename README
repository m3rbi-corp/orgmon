This server has 3 endpoints, each receiving Github events via Webhook.
We use ngrok in order to get github to integrate with our locally running server.

Besides the server, make sure you have ngrok installed locally.

Running the server:
    `pip3 install -r requirements`
    `python3 main.py`

Running ngrok:
    `ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR NGROK TOKEN HERE>`
    `ngrok http 1337`

make sure to update the correct ngrok url in your Github organiztaion!
